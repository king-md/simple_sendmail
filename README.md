# Simple Sendmail - Learning Python through writing a Simple Email Sending program.

I created this project to help me with learning Python.
So, I set out to use this project to learn more about sending email from Python.
This is a super simple program that by itself is not useful.
BUt it certainly helped me understand a few little things about sending email via Python that differs greatly from how it is done in Perl.
I am told by a good friend that Python has some issues with 8-bit encoding.
Not sure of this myself, but I'm making note of it here for my future usaing of this learning code as a starting point to go further with any mail handling Python code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requires the "smtplib" library; otherwise, it is a stand alone program.

### Installing

Get a copy of the simple_sendmail repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/king-md/simple_sendmail.git
```

Copy the simple_sendmail.py program to the directory where you want to run it from.

```
Windows: copy src\simple_sendmail.py C:\DESTINATION

Linux: cp -p src/simple_sendmail.py /home/user/bin/.
```
